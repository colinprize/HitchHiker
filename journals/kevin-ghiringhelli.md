In the journals, every day that you work on the project, you must make an entry in your journal after you've finished that day. At a minimum, you will need to include the following information:

The date of the entry
A list of features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with, if applicable
A reflection on any design conversations that you had
At least one ah-ha! moment that you had during your coding, however small

Keep your journal in reverse chronological order. Always put new entries at the top.



## 5/25
Finally finished emergency contact features.   Had to create a new function to return a specific emergency contact, and then pass along the user_id from that contact and check if it matches the user id of the logged in user.  It took a while but once it finally worked was my "aha moment"

Also began working on implementing the ability for a user to get a list of every hike they've signed up for

## 5/24
Continued working on Emergency Contact endpoints.  Got 98% of the way done, just need to properly protect the edit emergency contact feature so that users can only edit their own

## 5/23
Pair programmed with Jonathan and helped him figure out an issue we were seeing with the "update user" function in backend auth.  Also started on Emergency Contact endpoint

Aha moment- figuring out how to pass the hashed password through to our update user function

Jonathan and I began building a table
