Today I worked on:

* Learning about React Redux and Redux Toolkit from the daily lecture.
* Almost functioning API endpoints for the Rides tables.

Our group reconvened to start the week and established our weekly goals of completing our back-end and authentication.  We have some of our endpoints working for top-level resources (users).  I am currently working on the Rides endpoints which are dependent on each hike instance.  Making sure that the unique id for each hike is registered in the API routers is what I am currently working on.

Today, I worked on:

* Organizing our current GitLab issues by creating labels for each feature number and applying them to each feature and story.
* Made PostgreSQL CREATE TABLE statements for the ride and ride_users tables.

Our group focused more heavily on organizing our tasks today.  Creating labels for each feature and applying them to each issue made it easier to visualize how our work is broken down.

I continue to learn about SQL queries.  I am working to maintain relational integrity with proper use of foreign keys.
